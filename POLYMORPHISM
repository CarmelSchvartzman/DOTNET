Polymorphism is often referred to as the third pillar of object-oriented programming, after encapsulation and inheritance. 
Polymorphism is a Greek word that means "many-shaped" and it has two distinct aspects:

At run time, objects of a derived class may be treated as objects of a base class

At run-time, the CLR looks up the run-time type of the object: 
        you can call a method on a base class, and cause a derived class's version of the method to be executed.
